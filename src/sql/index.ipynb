    "Transact SQL, often shortened to T-SQL, is Microsoft’s proprietary implementation of ANSI standard SQL. Transact SQL adds more power and programming functionality to ANSI SQL and is used exclusively with the SQL Server database management system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic T-SQL shares many elements with ANSI SQL and we do not make a distinction in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing you need to understand is that SQL, especially Transact SQL, is a legit programming language. It is relatively simplistic compared to the likes of Python, but it is fairly powerful non the less, and you cannot afford to be a lazy programmer. Most of the concepts from computer science 101 will apply to white SQL with the notable exception that SQL is a procedural programming language unlike most popular languages which are object oriented.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is organized in three parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Language Basics**\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is takes you through foundational T-SQL and it is recommended that you go through the tutorial in the order of the lessons given. The next two sections are in no particular order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced Topics**\n",
    "\n",
    "This section takes you into the heavier programming aspects of T-SQL. Here you will start to dive into issues of writing high performance code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions To Real World Problems**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a highly opinionated section where I share my solutions to recurring problems that I have tackled over the past 20 years. Fortunately, all this stuff was kept in various forums, emails, and Stack Overflow in addition to the stuff I keep at the top of my head.\n",
    " \n",
    "This section is basically me uploading two decades of coding experience to the internet. I am not saying the way I do things is the correct way. I am saying that this is what I did and feel free to steal and adapt to your use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Running The Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "All code examples have been run on SQL Server 2016 against the 2016 backup of the AdventureWorks database. Instructions on how to download and install the database can be found [here](https://github.com/MassStreetUniversity/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/adventure-works).\n",
    "\n",
    "To report an issue with an example you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Report the issue at Support@MassStreetUniversity.com.\n",
    "2. Get help from the community on the school Discord server which can be found [here](https://discord.gg/enfDGUH).\n",
