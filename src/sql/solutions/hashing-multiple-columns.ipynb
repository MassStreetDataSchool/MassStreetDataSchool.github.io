    "Usually, the values in columns are disparate enough that you really do not have to worry. For example, it was years before I actually discovered an edge case. However, I did discover at least one scenario where concatenating the columns was not enough to develop a unique record. This occurred in a table with few columns and small amounts of data.\n",
