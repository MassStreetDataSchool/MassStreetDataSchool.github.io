    "We're gonna loop back to talking about loops (see what I did there?).\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for the step back is because there are objects in Python that work with for loops in ways that make iterating through complex objects really easy. List, tuples, and dictionaries are three of those objects. I had to introduce them first before I showed you how to loop through them with for.\n",
    "\n",
    "For loops are another basic concept in computer science and you will find the for construct in most programming languages. For is my preferred way of looping. \n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, the for loop construct in Python is not like the for found in other programming languages. In other languages, you usually define a condition that is checked against an incrementing value like we saw back when we were talking about while. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the for loop is for iterating over sequences. Those sequences can be the three complex data types that we are already familiar with. Later, we will see that sequences can include things like file names which comes in handy when you need to do work on a bunch of files in a folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in while, for can be used with break and continue to control the flow of the execution."
