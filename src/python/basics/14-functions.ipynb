    "\n",
    "After a while, you will start to notice that you write the same block of code over and over. It might be the case that other blocks of code use this code, so you cut and paste the lines into other blocks. This is a classic example of code that needs to be turned into a function.\n",

    "\n",
    "Any block of code that you can write that is valid Python syntax can be placed inside of a function. There are practical limitations here, but, again, we will cover that in a more advanced tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can design your function in a manner such that it just does stuff without any outside input and the function does not produce any output. However, most likely, your function needs to do different things based on information passed to it by the line of code that activated it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You pass in information to functions through function parameters which are frequently referred to as arguments. You can send back output using the return keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are writing Python as a series of scripts and not as an object-oriented program, the code executes from top to bottom. That means functions HAVE to be defined before they can be used."
