    "I’m a pretty chill person. It’s hard to harsh my mellow. One thing that does send me into a blinding rage is poorly formatted hard to read code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Software engineers don’t just work in teams simultaneously. They also work as a relay team. Engineers come and go, but the code base of an organization may be around for decades. \n",
    "\n",
    "When an engineer moves on, somebody will be brought in to replace that person. That person is going to have to pick up where the last engineer left off. Once you start working as a software engineer, you will discover very quickly that trying to read other people’s code is a special kind of hell rivaled only by you trying to read your own code from a few days ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting everybody on the same page in terms of how to write code helps with this problem. If you work at a large enough organization, they might have a coding style guide that you will be expected to adhere to. The style guide will tell you how to name things and how your code should look. It may seem trivial but having a document and code review processes that demand things like having x number of spaces between lines of code can be the difference between being appropriately productive and mad chaos.\n",
    "\n",
    "Corporate style guides are great, but they are specific to that organization. Python has a style guide built into its interpreter that ensures there is something of a universal standard in how your code looks.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a new person, the main things you need to be concerned about is spaces between code blocks and indenting.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using JuypterLab, space between code blocks will not be that big a deal. If you are using PyCharm to develop with, PyCharm will bark at you if you have more than 2 lines of white space between code blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indenting is another matter. The number of lines of space between code isn’t a deal breaker. Improperly indented code will blow your script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indenting is how the interpreter figures out what belongs to what. For example, take a look at this while code."
