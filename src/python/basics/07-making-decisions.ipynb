    "When I worked at Accenture, I was embedded with another company's software engineering team. The team had a funny saying. \"Put some smarts in it.\" That's a reference to creating business logic around whatever ever we were attempting to automate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole bloody point of writing software in the first place is to automate business processes. However, business is complex. If you have not started your professional career, you may not be aware just how complex business processes can be or how ridiculous they can get.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most business processes are filled with all kinds of exceptions to rules. As you are automating processes, you have to figure out what to do when your software has to do something different based different inputs into the software. You have to “put some smarts in it.”\n",
    "\n",
    "That is what we are going to do in this section. We are going to learn to write software that is flexible enough to perform different functions when the situation calls for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has numerous tools that allow you to build flexible software. Most of those tools require you to use Boolean logic to test rather or not some condition is true.\n",

It is not practical to teach you basic computer science in a coding tutorial. However, I can spend a few minutes explaining Boolean logic because it is fundamental to developing business logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way computers currently work is that everything inside the box exist in one of two states. It is either on or it is off. Currently, there is no in between. Open up the case on your computer and all that whiz bang stuff that you are looking at breaks down to something being on or off.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the computer, this on or off state is represented by the numbers 1 and 0 with 1 representing on and 0 representing off. On and off can also be represented by the Boolean data type values of True and False. In the lecture on data types, I already showed you how if you cast the Boolean True to an integer value, it will evaluate to 1. The reason why is the binary nature of the current state of computer engineering.\n",
