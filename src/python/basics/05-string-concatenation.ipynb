    "Also notice how I have written the double backslashes. That is because the backslash has special meaning in Python. The backslash is used to denote that a special character is coming like \\n which represents the ASCII linefeed value. The backslash escapes the n so the Python interpreter knows that \\n means LF and not just the literal string '\\n'.\n",
