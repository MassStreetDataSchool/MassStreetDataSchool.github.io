    "Python is different from practically every other programming language that I have worked with in that you do not explicitly define data types. When you create a variable, you have to assign it a value. How you assign it a value will define the data type of the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are coming from another programming language, or are familiar with OO programming in general, then you may be familiar with the idea that class and data type are synonymous. Classes are objects and everything in Python is an object. That makes discussions about data types in Python simpler than it would be in other languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson goes over what I like to call the fundamental data types. These are the data types that you would find in all programming languages. Data types unique to Python like list and tuples are discussed in their own lessons.\n",

    "<strong>String</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "Python stores textual data using the str object. Python has a lot of power to manipulate strings which we will be learning about in later lessons. Once you figure out how easy it is to work with string data in Python, you probably won’t want to learn any other programming language ever again.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Boolean</strong>\n",

    "<strong>Integers</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, Python supports every integer value between positive and negative infinity. In practice, you will be limited by your machine’s memory. \n",

    "<strong>Float</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "Floats are how Python represents decimal values in a non-precise way. What that means is, when you are working with floats, you have to look out for things like rounding errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Floats have their place in computer science, but, if you are going to work in analytics precision will be required.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Decimal</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is my recommended way to deal with real numbers. You have to be careful when you create your decimal value by passing the constructor either a string or integer value. If you pass the constructor a float value, the result will still suffer from approximation issues."
