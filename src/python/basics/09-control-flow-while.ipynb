    "In your software engineering career, you will have occasion to repeatedly execute a block of code based on some condition. In every programming language, there are a couple of constructs that allow you to do this. In this lesson, I am going to introduce one of the Python looping methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The while loop is not the best way to create loops in Python. However, it is a construct that exist that is fundamental to the language, so I am going to explain how it works now. In later lessons, we will learn a more efficient looping tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "The while loop is aptly named. Do something while some condition exists. The key thing to remember is that the condition is checked at the top of the loop. Not understanding that is how you wind up with code executing outside of the range that you intended. \n",
    "\n",
    "While loops are a huge source of bugs in your code. If you do not construct your loop properly you can wind up with code that performs outside of the bounds defined by your condition, or, you can wind up with the dreaded infinite loop. \n",
    "\n",
    "An infinite loop is exactly like it sounds. Your loop will go on forever until you either stop the interpreter, or you eat all the resources on your machine. Neither of these events are desirable. Put another way, you want to avoid those things happening at all cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>break AND continue</strong> \n",
    "\n",
    "While works with two other constructs: break and continue. You use these constructs when you need to get out of your loop or skip some code in your loop.\n",

    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><strong>break</strong>: Breaks you out of the loop. Control returns to the code block after the loop.</li><br>\n",
    "    <li><strong>continue</strong>: Skips the rest of the code in your loop and sends control back to the top of the loop for a condition check. </li><br>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "That continue statement is clearly another opportunity for you to mess up and get fired. Make sure that, wherever you put your continue statement, it does not prevent any incrementors from executing, or, at the least, code for that scenario."
