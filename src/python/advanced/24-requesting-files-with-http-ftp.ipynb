    "So, all the cool data is in the cloud, right? The ubiquitous cloud? Is a third-party bank’s on prim file server part of the cloud? Whatever. The point is the data is not local so we gotta go out and get it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to this point, when we snag a file from the internet, we have been doing it with Pandas. That’s cool, but the problems is when you download a file with Pandas, it gets loaded into a data frame which is limited by your machine’s memory before it gets written to disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, I am going to show you how to skip the data frame and just write a file straight to disk. We will be using a module called urllib to yank files off the internet using the same protocols used to retrieve webpages.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am also going to show you how to get files from an FTP server which can be kind of a goat rope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you need to get data from an FTP server. However, the data is probably sensitive so you cannot transfer the file in clear text. Here is where secured FTP (SFTP) comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to run the SFTP example below you will need to do two things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pip install <a href=\" https://pypi.org/project/pysftp/\" target=\"_blank\"> pysftp </a>. This is the module that we are going to use to download our file stored on a secured server.\n",

    "We also need to install some sort of graphical FTP too. I use <a href=\" https://winscp.net/eng/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">WinSCP</a>. We are going to need this tool to explore the FTP server so we can find out what we need to write our download script."

    "We are going to download some beef data from the USDA website. We are going to pull down an XML file, but the file is not sitting static on the server. The file is built from a reports generating application on the USDA server. \n",

    "Normally users get their data by using the web application’s GUI. But we need to automate things. So, the strategy is to use the GUI once. When you do that, you take note of the query string that gets built in the URL. Then you make Python variables out of any URL parameters. Now you can bypass the GUI and automate the process of downloading the data."
