    "The method read_csv is a workhorse in the data analytics world. Techncially, it has the capability to download zip files by itself. However there is some limitation with data.world where read_csv() will not work on zip files that are stored there. Since all of MSU's sample datasets reside in Data.World, we need to develop a workaround so you can work through the lessons in the solutions section."
