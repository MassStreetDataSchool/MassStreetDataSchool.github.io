    "Error processing is important in any programming language. Weird things will happen, and your code has to be ready to handle weirdness. Sometimes you know what weirdness to expect like a variable value being NULL, and you have to program what to do in that instance. Other times, the user will do something unexpected and you have to write a general error handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, the point of error processing is to keep the program going when an error happens. The general process is:\n",

    "<li>Trap the error.</li><br>\n",
    "<li>Perform alternative task.</li><br>\n",
    "<li>Report the error.</li><br>\n",

    "T-SQL has a way to trap errors with the standard TRY CATCH approach that you will find in most major\n",

    "It is rare when I do error processing. When I build data warehouse load processes, each stored procedure I write performs a single task. An example would be a stored procedure that does nothing but load a single dimension table. The entire load process is engineered so that an error brings the entire thing to a halt. I do this to prevent train wrecks. Load processing is a series of events that have to happen in order. When a load processes in any other way than intended, then the train wreck metaphor becomes readily apparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since my processes run in SQL Server Agent, any errors are logged without me having to write code. However, from time to time, I do have to write errors. Recently, I had to write code that was going to be leveraged by an application written in .NET. In this case, reporting errors was necessary so they could be reported to the user."
