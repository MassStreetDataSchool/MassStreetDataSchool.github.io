    "As the name suggest, an indexed view is a view with an index. An indexed view is bound to the tables that the view is based on. This creates and important constraint. \n",

    "This is where knowing T-SQL comes in handy. When I need to make a change to a table, I will do it programmatically. In the script prior to the alter statement, I will drop the view. After the alter statement, I will recreate the view.\n",
    "\n",
    "My primary use case for indexed views is using them to mirror data warehouse tables. I do not allow anybody that is not a data engineer access to the original tables. Not even on a read only basis. I create the index views for reports analyst. These are people that know SQL, but have no need to see the audit columns used to run the database."

Since I do not specify a schema, the view will go into the dbo schema where there is not an object already named person. This will come in handy as you will see in the section titled <a href=\"../solutions/load-large-files.html\">Loading Large CSVs Into Data Warehouse Staging Tables</a>."
