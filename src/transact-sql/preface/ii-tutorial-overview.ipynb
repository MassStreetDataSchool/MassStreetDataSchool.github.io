    "Transact SQL, often shortened to T-SQL, is Microsoft’s proprietary implementation of ANSI standard SQL. Transact SQL adds more power and programming functionality to ANSI SQL and is used exclusively with the SQL Server database management system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic T-SQL shares many elements with ANSI SQL and we do not make a distinction in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing you need to understand is that SQL, especially Transact SQL, is a legit programming language. It is relatively simplistic compared to the likes of Python, but it is fairly powerful none the less, and you cannot afford to be a lazy programmer. Most of the concepts from computer science 101 will apply.\n",

    "This tutorial is organized in three parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Language Basics</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "This section takes you through foundational T-SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Advanced Topics</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "This section takes you into the heavier programming aspects of T-SQL. Here you will start to dive into issues of writing high performance code.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Solutions To Real World Problems</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a highly opinionated section where I share my solutions to recurring problems that I have tackled over the past 20 years. Fortunately, all this stuff was kept in various forums, emails, and Stack Overflow in addition to the stuff I keep at the top of my head.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are brand new to T-SQL and SQL Server, much of this section may go over your head. That is ok. File it away for later.\n",
    " \n",
    "This section is basically me uploading two decades of coding experience to the internet. I am not saying the way I do things is the correct way. I am saying that this is what I did and feel free to steal and adapt to your use case."
