    "In this section, your query skills are going to take a quantum leap from interesting to useful. \n",
    "\n",
    "Databases are collections of tables that are built in a manner such that they store data in the form of a relationship. Unless you are looking at a flat reporting table, the only way you are going to get what you need is by creating queries that combine information from more than one table.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many kinds of relationships in a database. Talking about them all is beyond the scope of this tutorial. We will talk about how to identify relationships so you can figure out how to query a table. \n",
    "\n",
    "Table relationships are set up as parent child. In the most common example, the records in a parent table have one to many related records in a child table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationships are defined by keys. In SSMS, you can expand the columns of a table and see that there will be a key icon denoting that column as a key of some sort. There are two kinds of keys you need to be aware of.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary keys. Denoted in SSMS by the PK indicator in the column display. These keys are unique identifiers of tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign keys. Denoted in SSMS by the FK indicator in the column display. These keys are the primary keys of a child table’s parent table. If the database is designed properly, the column will be the same name in both tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "You join tables by connecting them by their keys using the JOIN ON clause. \n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>JOIN the table you would like to add to the query.</li><br>\n",
    "<li>ON the primary key and foreign key of the tables.</li><br>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can see why aliases come in handy. When you join more than one table, you have to fully qualify column names so SQL Server knows which column in which table you are referring to. It would be annoying to have to write out the table name so many times.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different kinds of joins and more than one join syntax. From a syntax perspective, I will be teaching you my preferred way to write joins."

This comes in handy when you want to see where there are records with no match or when the join between two tables is interesting but not necessarily an absolute reporting requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The left and right notation refers to which table you want to return all records from. If you want all records from the left table, then you write the query so that table is on the left side of the equality in the ON clause and vice versa.\n",
