    "You can combine the results set of more than one query without joining the tables together. The result sets of the tables have to have the same number of columns. The final column output will be defined by the column names in the first SQL statement. In actual practice, it is good to alias table and column names that are different so you can keep track of where things are going and what things are.\n",

This statement may be joining data across servers. The bottom line is, whatever the user is after, it could not be generated with a single SQL statement."
