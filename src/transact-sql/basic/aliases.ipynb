    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>When you create a column based on a calculation, SQL Server does not automatically give it a name. You have to do that.</li><br>\n",
    "<li>When you are creating views for users you do not want to use ugly database names. You can rename the column to something that will show up pretty in the user’s BI tool.</li><br>\n",
    "<li>Sometimes you want to rename things for your own personal sanity. When you are pulling data from more than one table and those tables have the same column names, it can become confusing in a hurry.</li><br>\n",
