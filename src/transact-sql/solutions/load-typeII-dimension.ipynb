    "<h1>Lesson 59. Loading A Type II Slowly Changing Dimension With SQL Merge</h1>"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "If you are a regular user of SSIS to do ETL work, you are probably aware of the Slowly Changing Dimension Transformation. You are also probably keenly aware of its performance limitations. Even if it were the highest performing component, I still would not use it. My personal philosophy when it comes to ETL is to use SSIS for orchestration. All the heavy lifting of loading and cleaning data, I do in T-SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loading data into tables is usually a straightforward process. Loading Type II SCDs is anything but straightforward. Fortunately, this job is made easier by the T-SQL MERGE statement. As far as I know, MERGE is the most powerful, complex operation in the entire T-SQL toolbox. It is chock full of features and options that give engineers a lot of flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much has already been written on how to load SCDs. Some of that material is of varying quality. I do not want to spend time going over well-trodden ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I want to do instead is show how this is done in the real world. There is a bug in SQL Server that many code samples do not address. The MERGE statement will fail if you attempt to load a Type II SCD with common techniques found on the internet. The problem is, you are not allowed to load a dimension with a foreign key in this way. The workaround is to use a temp table. That technique is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this code, you will need a copy of SQL Server 2016 which is free for development. I explain what I am doing step by step below, but the script can be run in totality with a single press of F5.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is fairly close to how I do ETL in the real world. In general, the pattern is:<br>\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>Import data to staging.</li><br>\n",
    "<li>Load new data into the common model.</li><br>\n",
    "<li>Load the data warehouse from the common model.</li><br>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are differences between the script and a real-world process.<br>\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>I put common model tables in their own schema.</li><br>\n",
    "<li>Staging tables are also grouped by schema according to the source data.</li><br>\n",
    "<li>All of the data quality checks have been removed.</li><br>\n",
    "<li>Post processing ETL load checks have been removed.</li><br>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "Key to loading SCDs is how you handle effective to and from dates. Some people think that “to” dates are not even necessary. The to/from scheme is what I encounter the most out in the wild. While they are called SLOWLY changing dimension, stuff happens. To protect against a change within the same day, I have chosen to end the previous record a second before the new one. This approach has its issues:<br>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>You have overlapping days.</li><br>\n",
    "<li>Should you have to reload a fact table, overlapping days could cause problems.</li><br>\n",
    "<li>This approach could play havoc with any BI tool that sits on this data.</li><br>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "I am sure there are more issues that I could think of. At the end of the day, there is no right answer. This approach works for my use case. Under different circumstances, I will use a different solution. The main thing is that executives get their data and leave you alone so you can create more cool things."
