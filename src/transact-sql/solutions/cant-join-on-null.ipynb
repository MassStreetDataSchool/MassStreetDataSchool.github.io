    "This is a fairly common and insidious error because you might not catch the problem if you are working with a large amount of data. Basically, NULL means unknown and unknown cannot equal unknown, so you cannot join records on null values. The best thing to do is not have NULLs in candidate key fields.\n",

    "\"No, it is not weird. It actually follows from the definitions in the ANSI/ISO standards. The in fixed notation that we use now, was actually a result of an article published by Chris Date in one of the database newsstand magazines of the time (he and I had columns in DBMS and Database Programming and Design, and they were both owned by the same publisher at one point).\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual syntax was not proposed by Date, by one of the ANSI X3H2 committee members. The rule is that infixed joins are evaluated strictly left to right, and the ON clause associates with the nearest join. If I have a really complicated set of inner joins, I prefer to use the original set-oriented notation (no infixed operators). People that use infixed inner join have a mindset locked into + versus \"big Sigma\" from mathematics.\""
