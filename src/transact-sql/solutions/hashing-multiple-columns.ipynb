    "When using the HASHBYTES() function in SQL Server to hash multiple columns for matching, use CONCAT() and separate values with a pipe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, the values in columns are disparate enough that you really do not have to worry. For example, it was years before I actually discovered an edge case. However, I did discover at least one scenario where concatenating the columns was not enough to develop a unique record. This occurred in a table with few columns and small amounts of data.\n",

    "A better approach is to just CONCAT() columns with a pipe between values. Since this character is rarely used, it lowers the probability of having different values hash the same."
