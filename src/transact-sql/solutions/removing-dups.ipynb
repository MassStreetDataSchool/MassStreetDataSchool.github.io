    "This generates three outputs so you can see the results of the table load operation. The first output is from the products dimension table where you can see that there are duplicates in the data. The second is from the product sales fact table. If you’re sharp, you can see that there are fact records attached to the duplicate dimension records. The final query shows the results of a join between the two tables where you can again see the impact of having duplicate dimension records.\n",

First, we have to reassign those fact records to the prime dimension record, then we can blow away the unnecessary dimension records. Picking which dimension record is the prime dimension record is complex and beyond the scope of this tutorial. For now, we’ll just choose an arbitrary record and call that the prime record.\n",

    "\n",
    "The process of de-duplication works like this. First, we group and number the records in the dimension table. The numbering will tell you if there is more than one instance of a specific record. We use ROW_NUMBER() to assign ordinal values to the dimension records and group the counting by ProductName. We load these records into a table variable, so they are easy to work with. Any records with a Row Number value of 1 are original records. Any record with a Row Number value greater than 1 is a duplicate.\n",
