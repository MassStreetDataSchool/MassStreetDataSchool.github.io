    "There may be an error in the source system.\n",

    "Whatever the reason, having duplicate data in your data warehouse means your numbers may not add up right. The best place to get rid of dups is in the ETL process, but sometimes you find mistakes in data after you load it to prod. When you are confident in your code, and you are sure any duplicates are in fact duplicate records from a business perspective, you will need a way to get rid of them. The technique below utilizes the ROW_NUMBER() function.\n",

    "This generates three outputs so you can see the results of the table load operation. The first output is from the products dimension table where you can see that there are duplicates in the data. The second is from the product sales fact table. If you’re sharp, you can see that there are fact records attached to the duplicate dimension records. The final query shows the results of a join between the two tables where you can again see the impact of having duplicate dimension records.\n",

First, we have to reassign those fact records to the prime dimension record, then we can blow away the unnecessary dimension records. Picking which dimension record is the prime dimension record is complex and beyond the scope of this tutorial. For now, we’ll just choose an arbitrary record and call that the prime record.\n",

For now, just go on faith and follow this example. When you get a minute, you can read the TSQL documentation. CTEs are fairly common, but the ROW_NUMBER() function might be new to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of de-duplication works like this. First, we group and number the records in the dimension table. The numbering will tell you if there is more than one instance of a specific record. We use ROW_NUMBER() to assign ordinal values to the dimension records and group the counting by ProductName. We load these records into a table variable, so they are easy to work with. Any records with a Row Number value of 1 are original records. Any record with a Row Number value greater than 1 is a duplicate.\n",
