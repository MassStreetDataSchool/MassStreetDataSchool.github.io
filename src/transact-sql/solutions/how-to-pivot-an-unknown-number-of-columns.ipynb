    "When does that even happen in the real world?! Never. That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works.\n",

    "Unfortunately, this story is only partially made up. I don't really talk like this, but the request for the shape of his data totally happened. \n",
    "\n",
    "But hey. This is business analytics. We're ALL about some customer service. So we gives the people what they wants!\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of this code is magic that I can't explain and that’s fine. I can use it that’s what matters. I just keep this query handy and alter it every time I need to do this. \n",
    "Most of it is straight forward SQL. It’s the end that gets weird. We’re going to take all the possible columns and STUFF them into a variable using XML PATH. Then we are going to build our dynamic statement. Most of the code there should be familiar from the standard PIVOT example. The only difference is the columns variable is providing the columns instead of a hard coded value."
