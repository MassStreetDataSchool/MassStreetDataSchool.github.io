    "Some of this code is magic that I can't explain and that’s fine. I can use it, that’s what matters. I just keep this query handy and alter it every time I need to do this. \n",
    "Most of it is straight forward SQL. It’s the end that gets weird. We’re going to take all the possible columns and STUFF them into a variable using XML PATH. Then we are going to build our dynamic statement. Most of the code there should be familiar from the standard PIVOT example. The only difference is the columns variable is providing the columns instead of a hard coded value."
