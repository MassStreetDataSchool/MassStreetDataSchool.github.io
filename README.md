# Social Media Code Tutorials

This is the GitHub pages repo for code tutorials that are shared on social media. These tutorials are the quick reference version as opposed to GitBook version that you'll find on the <a href="https://msds.massstreet.net/academics/tutorials/">Mass Street Data School</a> website.

Having the tutorials in full HTML gives me a level of control that GitBook doesn't have. However, the files are generated from Jupyter Lab which is not awesome but will do until I learn how to use <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.

The GitBook versions of the tutorials are considered the "system of record" for code tutorials. However, you want a more quick reference guide to coding with Python and T-SQL, you can check out the tutorials at the links below.
